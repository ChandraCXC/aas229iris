## Welcome!

This repository contains all the demo materials used in the **Flexible
Multi-dimensional Modeling of Complex Data in Astronomy for Iris** at the 229th
AAS meeting. 

The `worksheets` directory contains science threads to run through in
Iris. Worksheets with instructions on what to do are included, as well as the
relevant data.

In the `ots` directory are off-the-shelf software tools to be used with a
couple of the worksheets.

Please read the worksheets for information about each dataset.
