## Demo Directory

In this directory you will find the data to go along with the demo presented at the meeting.

- Q*-redshifted.vot -- the QSO templates from Elvis et al. (1994) used in the
  		       stacking demo
- `pks1127-14.vot` -- the aggregate SED built during the demonstration of 
                      PKS 1127-14, at redshift z=1.187.
- `pks1127-14_NED.vot` -- the dataset retrieved from NED with 
  		          target='pks 1127-14'. Use this file in case you can't
			  connect to the internet to use the NED SED Service.
- `pks1127-14_planck_data.vot` -- the PLANCK data used in the PKS 1127-14 demo
- `pks1127-14_r_3s_II_311_wise.fits` -- the unformatted WISE data that was 
  				        uploaded in TOPCAT at the beginning 
					of the PKS 1127-14 demo.
- `pks1127-14_frozen_fit.json` -- a final fit of PKS1127-14, if we continued
                                  fitting the SED over the full spectral range.
- `pks1127-14_frozen_fit.txt` -- the human-readable fit results of the full 
                                 PKS 1127-14 fit.
