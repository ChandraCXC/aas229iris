## Worksheets

In this directory you will find a couple of worksheets that walk you through a
number of science threads in Iris. There are multiple exmaples in each
directory.

Each worksheet directory

```
   demo
   integrate
   interoperability
   sedstacker
   template_fitting 
```

contain all the documentation and data needed to run the
threads.

The `data` directory contains all the data used in the worksheets, plus an 
extra spectrum:

- `HD127334-HARPN.fits` -- high resolution HARPS-North data of star HD127334

You are encouraged to try your own science threads and use your own
datasets. We will be there to help you out in the free period.
