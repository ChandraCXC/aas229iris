## Worksheets

In this directory you will find a couple of worksheets that walk you through a
number of science threads in Iris. There are multiple exmaples in each
directory.

Each worksheet directory

```
   integrate
   interoperability
   sedstacker
   template_fitting 
```

contain all the documentation and data needed to run the
threads.

The `data` directory contains all the data used in the worksheets, plus some
extras for you to play around with:

- `HD127334-HARPN.fits` -- high resolution HARPS-North data of star HD127334
- `pks1127-14.vot` -- the aggregate SED built during the demonstration of 
                      PKS 1127-14, at redshift z=1.187.
- `pks1127-14_planck_data.vot` -- the PLANCK data used in the PKS 1127-14 demo
- `pks1127-14_r_3s_II_311_wise.fits` -- the unformatted WISE data that was uploaded
                                    in TOPCAT at the beginning of the PKS
				    1127-14 demo.
- `pks1127-14_frozen_fit.json` -- a final fit of PKS1127-14, if we continued
                                  fitting the SED over the full spectral range.
- `pks1127-14_frozen_fit.txt` -- the human-readable fit results of the full 
                                 PKS 1127-14 fit.


You are encouraged to try your own science threads and use your own
datasets. We will be there to help you out in the free period.
